      "question": "What are the two main constraints that must be satisfied in the pumping lemma for regular languages?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "|xy| ≤ p and |z| ≥ 1",
        "b": "|xy| ≤ p and |y| ≥ 1", 
        "c": "|xyz| ≤ p and |y| ≥ 1",
        "d": "|y| ≤ p and |xy| ≥ 1"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The constraint is on |y| being at least 1, not |z|.",
        "b": "Correct. The pumping lemma for regular languages requires that |xy| ≤ p (the prefix xy has length at most p) and |y| ≥ 1 (the pumpable part y is non-empty).",
        "c": "Incorrect. The constraint is |xy| ≤ p, not |xyz| ≤ p.",

      "question": "In the pumping lemma for context-free languages, how many parts is a string decomposed into?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Three parts: x, y, z",
        "b": "Four parts: u, v, w, x",
        "c": "Five parts: u, v, w, x, y",
        "d": "Two parts: left and right"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Three parts (xyz) is the decomposition for regular languages.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Four parts would be incomplete for context-free language analysis.",
        "c": "Correct. The pumping lemma for context-free languages uses a five-part decomposition: w = uvwxy, where v and x are the pumpable segments.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. i = 1 represents the original string with no changes.",
        "b": "Incorrect. i = 2 would represent doubling the pumpable segments.",
        "c": "Correct. When i = 0, the pumpable segments (y in regular languages, or v and x in context-free languages) are removed entirely, testing whether the language still accepts the reduced string.",

      "question": "Why is the language L = {a^n b^n | n ≥ 0} not regular according to the pumping lemma?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because it contains infinitely many strings",
        "b": "Because pumping the 'y' segment creates unequal numbers of a's and b's",
        "c": "Because the string is too long to analyze",
        "d": "Because it uses two different symbols"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Many regular languages also contain infinitely many strings.",
        "b": "Correct. For any string a^p b^p with decomposition xyz where |xy| ≤ p, the y segment must consist only of a's. Pumping y (repeating it) creates more a's than b's, violating the equal-count requirement and proving the string is no longer in the language.",
        "c": "Incorrect. String length is not the determining factor for regularity.",

        "d": "|vwx| can be any length"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The constraint is an upper bound, not an exact equality.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This would violate the pumping lemma constraint.",
        "c": "Correct. The context-free pumping lemma requires |vwx| ≤ p, meaning the middle portion containing the pumpable segments must have length at most p.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The constraint allows one of them to be empty, just not both.",
        "b": "Correct. The constraint |vx| ≥ 1 means that at least one of v or x must be non-empty, ensuring that pumping actually changes the string.",
        "c": "Incorrect. If both were empty, pumping would have no effect.",

    {
      "question": "How can the pumping lemma be used to prove that a language is NOT regular or context-free?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By showing that the language satisfies all pumping conditions",
        "b": "By finding one string that can be successfully pumped",
        "c": "By proving that for any proposed decomposition, pumping violates language membership",
        "d": "By demonstrating that the language has finite size"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Satisfying pumping conditions doesn't prove non-membership; the lemma provides necessary but not sufficient conditions.",
        "b": "Incorrect. One successful pumping example doesn't prove anything about the entire language.",
        "c": "Correct. To prove a language is not regular/context-free, you assume it is, apply the pumping lemma to get a decomposition, then show that for ALL possible decompositions of a carefully chosen string, pumping produces a string outside the language.",

      "question": "Why does the language {a^n b^n c^n | n ≥ 0} fail the pumping lemma for context-free languages?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because it has three different symbols",
        "b": "Because pumping cannot maintain equal counts of all three symbols simultaneously",
        "c": "Because the strings are too long",
        "d": "Because it's actually a regular language"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The number of symbols doesn't determine context-freeness.",
        "b": "Correct. Given the constraint |vwx| ≤ p, the segments v and x can span at most two of the three symbol types (a, b, c). Pumping v and x the same number of times cannot increase all three symbol counts equally, violating the language's requirement for equal counts.",
        "c": "Incorrect. String length itself doesn't determine language class membership.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This language is neither regular nor context-free; it's context-sensitive."

    {
      "question": "What is the fundamental reason why pumping lemmas provide necessary but not sufficient conditions for language classification?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because the lemmas are incorrectly formulated",
        "b": "Because some non-regular/non-CF languages may still satisfy pumping conditions",
        "c": "Because pumping can only be applied to finite languages",
        "d": "Because the lemmas work only for binary alphabets"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The pumping lemmas are correctly formulated and widely accepted results.",
        "b": "Correct. The pumping lemmas provide necessary conditions (if a language is regular/CF, then it must satisfy pumping), but not sufficient conditions. Some languages that are not regular or context-free might still satisfy the pumping conditions, so the lemmas can only be used to prove non-membership, not membership.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Pumping lemmas apply to infinite languages.",
